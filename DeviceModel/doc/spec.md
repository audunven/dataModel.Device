## List of properties  

- `alternateName`: An alternative name for this item  - `annotations`: Annotations about the item  - `brandName`: Device's brand name.  - `category`: Sensor: A device that detects and responds to events or changes in the physical environment such as light, motion, or temperature changes. https://w3id.org/saref#Sensor. actuator : A device responsible for moving or controlling a mechanism or system. https://w3id.org/saref#Actuator. Meter : A device built to accurately detect and display a quantity in a form readable by a human being. Partially defined by SAREF. HVAC : Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) device that provides indoor environmental comfort. https://w3id.org/saref#HVAC. Network : A device used to connect other devices in a network, such as hub, switch or router in a LAN or Sensor network. (https://w3id.org/saref#Network. Multimedia : A device designed to display, store, record or play multimedia content such as audio, images, animation, video. Enum:'actuator, beacon, endgun, HVAC, implement, irrSection, irrSystem, meter, multimedia, network, sensor'  - `color`: The color of the product  - `controlledProperty`: Anything that can be sensed, measured or controlled by. Enum:'airPollution, atmosphericPressure, averageVelocity, batteryLife, batterySupply, cdom, conductance, conductivity, depth, eatingActivity, electricityConsumption, energy, fillingLevel, freeChlorine, gasConsumption, gateOpening, heading, humidity, light, location, milking, motion, movementActivity, noiseLevel, occupancy, orp, pH, power, precipitation, pressure, refractiveIndex, salinity, smoke, soilMoisture, solarRadiation, speed, tds, temperature, trafficFlow, tss, turbidity, waterConsumption, waterFlow, waterLevel, waterPollution, weatherConditions, weight, windDirection, windSpeed'  - `dataProvider`: A sequence of characters identifying the provider of the harmonised data entity.  - `dateCreated`: Entity creation timestamp. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `dateModified`: Timestamp of the last modification of the entity. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `description`: A description of this item  - `deviceClass`: Class of constrained device as specified by RFC 7228. If the device is not a constrained device this property shall not be present. Normative References: [RFC7228](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7228#section-3). Enum:'C0, C1, C2'  - `documentation`: A link to device's documentation.  - `energyLimitationClass`: Device's class of energy limitation as per RFC 7228. Normative References: [RFC7228](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7228#page-11). Enum:'E0, E1, E2, E9'  - `function`: The functionality necessary to accomplish the task for which a Device is designed. A device can be designed to perform more than one function. Defined by [SAREF](https://w3id.org/saref#Function). Enum:'levelControl, sensing, onOff, openClose, metering, eventNotification  - `id`: Unique identifier of the entity  - `image`: An image of the item  - `macAddress`: The MAC address of the device.  - `manufacturerName`: Device's manufacturer name.  - `modelName`: Device's model name.  - `name`: The name of this item.  - `owner`: A List containing a JSON encoded sequence of characters referencing the unique Ids of the owner(s)  - `seeAlso`: list of uri pointing to additional resources about the item  - `source`: A sequence of characters giving the original source of the entity data as a URL. Recommended to be the fully qualified domain name of the source provider, or the URL to the source object.  - `supportedProtocol`: Supported protocol(s) or networks  - `supportedUnits`: Units of measurement supported by the device. The unit code (text) of measurement given using the [UN/CEFACT Common Code](http://wiki.goodrelations-vocabulary.org/Documentation/UN/CEFACT_Common_Codes) (max. 3 characters).  - `type`: NGSI Entity type. it has to be DeviceModel

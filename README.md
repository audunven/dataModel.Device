# dataModel.Device
These data models allow to represent devices of different nature (IoT, mobile, wearable, etc.).

### List of data models

The following entity types are available:
- [Device](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.Device/blob/master/Device/README.md). An apparatus (hardware + software + firmware) intended to accomplish a particular task (sensing the environment, actuating, etc.).

- [DeviceModel](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.Device/blob/master/DeviceModel/README.md). This entity captures the static properties of a Device. 

- [PrivacyObject](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.Device/blob/master/PrivacyObject/README.md). Information about privacy for an IoT device

- [SmartMeteringObservation](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.Device/blob/master/SmartMeteringObservation/README.md). This entity contains a harmonised description of a Smart Meter Observation, generally applicable for Smart Homes, Industry, Cities and Agriculture. It is based mostly in the GSMA entity definition but it is extended
